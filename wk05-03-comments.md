    The Why and How of Comments
    As your programs get longer and more complicated, 
    some additional English explanation can be used to help you and other programmers read your code. 
    These explanations called comments document your code, much the way docstrings document your functions.

===

    A comment begins with the number sign character (#) and goes until the end of the line. 
    One name for this character is the hash character. 
    Python ignores any lines that start with this character.

    Comments are intended for programmers to read, and are usually there to explain the purpose of a function, 
    as well as to describe relationships between your variables. 
    Comments are to help you, and anyone else who is reading/using your code, 
    to remember or understand the purpose of a given variable or function in a program.
