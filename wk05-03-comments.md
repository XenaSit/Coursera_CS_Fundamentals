<h3>The Why and How of Comments</h3>

As your programs get longer and more complicated, some additional English explanation can be used to help you and other programmers read your code. 
These explanations called comments document your code, much the way docstrings document your functions.

    Whenever you write a loop there's going to be a relationship between your variables. Try and figure out what that relationship is and you'll have an easier time writing your loop body.

    Also, once you figure out that relationship, write it down. Put it in a comment so that you don't have to figure it out again the next time you read the code.

    A comment begins with the number sign character (#) and goes until the end of the line. 
    One name for this character is the hash character. 
    Python ignores any lines that start with this character.

    Comments are intended for programmers to read, and are usually there to explain the purpose of a function, as well as to describe relationships between your variables. 
    Comments are to help you, and anyone else who is reading/using your code, 
    to remember or understand the purpose of a given variable or function in a program.
